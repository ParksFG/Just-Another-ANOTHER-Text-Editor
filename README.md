## Description

This is a simple text editor web app.  I made this to test working with web apps, specifically webpacks.  Webpacks can be rather annoying to work with, but they do provide very useful utilites.  If you have a good text editor this won't change your life, however it is nice to have another one that'll always have quick extra notes to use whenever I may need them.
